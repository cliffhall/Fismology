### Working in the Fismology Lab
Fismo is not your average protocol. It's straight-up weird. But so is protein folding, and that's why people show up to the lab every day to study it.

There is no specific set of steps for integrating Fismo into your project. It could be the core component around which the whole architecture hangs. Or it could just model a minor stateful mechanism in a much larger ecosystem of contracts. 

The Fismology Lab has been established as a place where we can explore the various possibilities, create some useful tools, and realize that potential together.

So put on your goggles, grab your lab coat, and clone or fork the [Fismology repo](https://github.com/cliffhall/Fismology) and then get going:

* ðŸ“‹ [`Environment Setup`](setup.md) - Setup your local development environment.
* ðŸ“‹ [`Tasks`](tasks.md) - Common dev tasks implemented as NPM scripts.
