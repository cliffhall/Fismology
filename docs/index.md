# Building With the Fismo SDK
##### Working in the Fismology Lab
> _Fismo is not your average protocol. It's straight-up weird. But so is protein folding, and that's why people show up to the lab every day to study it._

[Fismo](https://github.com/cliffhall/Fismo) machines are a way of simulating processes, branching narratives, maps of places, or nearly any stateful thing you can imagine.

There is no specific set of steps for integrating Fismo into your project. It could be the core component around which the whole architecture hangs. Or it could just model a minor stateful mechanism in a much larger ecosystem of contracts.

The Fismology Lab has been established as a place where we can explore the possibilities, create some useful tools, and realize Fismo's potential together.
