# Building with the Fismo SDK
[Fismo](https://github.com/cliffhall/Fismo) machines are a way of simulating processes, branching narratives, maps of places, or nearly any stateful thing you can imagine. 

This project explores ways of using Fismo to build cool things.

Fismo is a new protocol, so there's no prescriptive way of implementing it in your project. Eventually, there will be more advanced tooling for creating and configuring a machine, installing it, initializing it and interacting with it. 

The approach is:
  * Clone the repo
  * Configure the environment
  * Clone Fismo and Operator on a supported chain
  * Conceive and configure a Fismo style state machine
  * Create a folder under `contracts/lab`



#### Lab Experiments
  * ðŸ§ª [Locked Door Machine](experiment/lockable-door.html)
    * âœ… Token-gated state transition
    * âœ… Machine-specific storage slots
    * âœ… Guard contract initializers
    * âœ… Contextually suppressed actions
